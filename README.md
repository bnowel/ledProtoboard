Atmel mega 328P arduino project

There are a few libraries needed to make this work.
* Accelerometer helpers https://github.com/joruiz/ADXL362
* LowPower (Link coming, think I just got it off the Arduino site)
* 

The Accelerometer library is a fork from the standard ADXL362 code offered off the manufacturer site. It fixes a bug in manufacturer version so you can actually read x,y,z,temperature data.
